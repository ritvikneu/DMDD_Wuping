/* In an investment company, bonuses are handed out to the top-performing
   employees every quarter. There is a business rule that no employee can
   be granted more than a total of $200,000 as bonuses per year and a single
   bonus can't exceed $50,000. Any attempt to give an employee more than 
   $200,000 for bonuses in a year and/or a single bonus more than $50,000
   must be logged in an audit table and the violating bonus is not allowed.

   Given the following 3 tables, please write a trigger to implement
   the business rule. The rule must be enforced every year automatically.
   Assume only one bonus is entered in the database at a time.
   You can just consider the INSERT scenarios.
